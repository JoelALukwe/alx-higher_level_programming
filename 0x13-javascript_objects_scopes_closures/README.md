0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

this project used only javascript

the questions i mostly tackled included but not limited to

Why JavaScript programming is amazing
How to create an object in JavaScript
What this means
What undefined means
Why the variable type and scope is important
What is a closure
What is a prototype
How to inherit an object from another



the project tasks included

0. Rectangle #0
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
You must use the class notation for defining your class


the output when ./0-main.js will be 

Rectangle {}
[Class: Rectangle]




1. Rectangle #1
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h


the  output ./1-main.js

Rectangle { width: 2, height: 3 }
2
3
Rectangle { width: 2, height: -3 }
2
-3
Rectangle { width: 2, height: undefined }
2
undefined 





2. Rectangle #2
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object


the output of ./2-main.js
Rectangle { width: 2, height: 3 }
2
3
Rectangle {}
undefined

Rectangle {}

Rectangle {}

undefined


3. Rectangle #3
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X


the output of ./3-main.js
XX
XX
XX
XXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXX






4. Rectangle #4
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2



the output of ./4-main.js
Normal:
XX
XX
XX
Double:
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX

Rotate:
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
